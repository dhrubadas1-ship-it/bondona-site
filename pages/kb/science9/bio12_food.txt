• Crop variety improvement: yield, quality, biotic/abiotic resistance, maturity duration.
• Crop production: soil preparation → sowing → manuring/fertilizers → irrigation → weeding → harvesting → storage.
• IPM: combine cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods to reduce pests.
• Animal husbandry: cattle, poultry, fisheries; breeding, feeding, disease control, housing.
