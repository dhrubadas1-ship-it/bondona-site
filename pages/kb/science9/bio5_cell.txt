[R1] Fundamental Unit of Life — Key Points
• Cell theory: all organisms are made of cells; cell is structural/functional unit; cells arise from pre-existing cells.
• Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes: nucleus absent vs present; membrane-bound organelles absent vs present.
• Organelles: membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, ER (Rough/Smooth), Golgi, lysosome, chloroplast (plants), vacuoles.
• Osmosis & diffusion; plasmolysis in plant cells; tonicity (hyper/hypo/iso).
