[R1] Force — Key Points
• Force is a push or pull; vector; can change state of motion or shape.
• Balanced forces → no change in motion; unbalanced forces → acceleration.
• Types: Contact (friction, tension, normal); Non-contact (gravitational, electrostatic, magnetic).
• Net force relates to acceleration via Newton’s second law (see Ch 8).
