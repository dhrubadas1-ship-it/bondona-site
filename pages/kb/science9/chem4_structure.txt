[R1] Structure of the Atom — Key Points
• Thomson: positive sphere with embedded electrons (obsolete).
• Rutherford: small dense nucleus, electrons orbit; most α pass through → atom mostly empty.
• Bohr: electrons in fixed shells; 2n^2 capacity; valency depends on outer shell.
• Z (atomic number) = p+ = e− (*neutral atom*); A (mass number) = p+ + n0.
• Isotopes: same Z, diff A (e.g., C-12, C-14). Isobars: same A, diff Z (e.g., 40Ar, 40Ca).
