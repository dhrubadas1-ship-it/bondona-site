[R1] Matter in our Surroundings — Key Points
• Particles of matter are very small, have spaces, and move continuously.
• Inter-particle attraction balances with kinetic energy → state (solid/liquid/gas).
• Solid: fixed shape/volume; Liquid: fixed volume, no fixed shape; Gas: no fixed shape/volume.
• State change at constant temperature → latent heat (fusion/vaporization).
• Factors affecting evaporation: temperature ↑, surface area ↑, wind ↑, humidity ↓.
• Kelvin scale: K = °C + 273.
• Sublimation: solid → gas without liquid (e.g., naphthalene, camphor).
